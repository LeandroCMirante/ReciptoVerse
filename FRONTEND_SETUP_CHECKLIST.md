## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'sonner'"

**Solution:** Run `npm install sonner` in frontend folder

### Issue: QR scanner shows black screen

**Solution:**

- Check camera permissions in browser
- Use HTTPS (cameras require secure context)
- Try manual entry mode as fallback

### Issue: Points not loading

**Solution:**

- Check backend is running on port 3001
- Verify JWT token exists: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify VITE_API_URL is set correctly

### Issue: Styles not applying

**Solution:**

- Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured
- Check `@/` path alias in vite.config.js
- Verify shadcn/ui components are installed

### Issue: "Mint Tokens" button disabled

**Solution:**

- User needs at least 100 points
- Award yourself points via merchant scanner first

### Issue: Confetti not showing

**Solution:**

- Ensure `canvas-confetti` is installed
- Check browser console for errors
- Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
